# 🪐 NASA Exoplanet Data Analysis Project

### What are Exoplanets :-
   An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system. There are about 6,000+ such exoplanets discovered currently. This dataset I analysed was publised on july 2023 when only 5,470 were discovered. Eventhough the dataset is published by Nasa,they include all exoplanets ever found around the globe.All discovery methods except pulsar timing uses light and gravity. 

### Why I choose this :-
  **1) High quality real world dataset** :-Since the data is published by NASA, it is extremely reliable and trustworthy. It covers space and astronomy—one of the most relevant and fascinating real-world scientific domains.<br><br>
  **2) Important and Relevent applications** :- Exoplanet research plays a major role in space exploration, identifying potentially habitable planets, understanding the formation of solar systems, and contributing to climate science through comparative planetology. <br><br>
  **3) Rich analysis work** :- This dataset allows a wide range of analytical techniques, including PCA, K-Means clustering, KNN imputation, and various data visualizations such as histograms, sunburst charts, Mollweide projections, and more.<br><br>
  **4) Interesting topic** :- Space, solar systems, and the outer universe have always fascinated me. Working with this dataset helped me explore these concepts in more depth and gain meaningful insights about exoplanets.<br><br>

  
### About Dataset :-

The dataset is “NASA Exoplanet Archive (July 2023)” from Kaggle shows confirmed exoplanets discovered as of July 2023 and its different characters like mass, density, eccentricity etc. All these datasets were recorded by different expeditions at different time period. The dataset contains 5470 rows and 26 subset columns (out of 353). Hence Dimension is:-  5470 X 26.

##  Key Insights

- The solar system with the most planets discovered is KOI-351 with 8 planets similar to our solar system.
- Top 10 nearest exoplanets are within 3.6 light-years from Earth.
- Exoplanet discovery peaked in 2016 with over 1517 planets discovered and was lowest at 1994 with 1 exoplanet being discovered.
- Most exoplanets are found at about 270 degree radius and K-Means indicates that there is no clear pattern for distribution of similar exoplanets around earth.
- 3D distribution shows exoplanets at northern sky from earth were mostly discovered in 2016 and exoplantes at southeren sky are mostly discovered after 2018.
- **Transit** is the most widely used method for discovering exoplanets.
- Discovery rates increased significantly after 2010, coinciding with the Kepler mission.
