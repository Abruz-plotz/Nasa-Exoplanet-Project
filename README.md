##  Key Insights

- The solar system with the most planets discovered is KOI-351 with 8 planets similar to our solar system.
- Top 10 nearest exoplanets are within 3.6 light-years from Earth.
- Exoplanet discovery peaked in 2016 with over 1517 planets discovered and was lowest at 1994 with 1 exoplanet being discovered.
- Most exoplanets are found at about 270 degree radius and K-Means indicates that there is no clear pattern for distribution of similar exoplanets around earth.
- 3D distribution shows exoplanets at northern sky from earth were mostly discovered in 2016 and exoplantes at southeren sky are mostly discovered after 2018.
- **Transit** is the most widely used method for discovering exoplanets.
- Discovery rates increased significantly after 2010, coinciding with the Kepler mission.
